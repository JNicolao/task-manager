## Usage Guide

### Creating Tasks

1. Click the **"New Task"** button in the header
2. Fill in the task details:
   - **Title**: Brief description of the task
   - **Description**: Detailed information (optional)
   - **Category**: Work, Personal, Health, or Learning
   - **Priority**: Low, Medium, or High
   - **Estimated Duration**: Time you expect the task to take
   - **Due Date**: Optional deadline

### Time Tracking

1. Click the **Play button** on any task to start tracking time
2. The task status automatically changes to "In Progress"
3. Click the **Pause button** to stop tracking
4. Time is automatically recorded when you mark the task as complete

### Viewing Analytics

Navigate to the **Analytics** tab to view:
- **Completion Rate**: Percentage of tasks completed
- **Average Task Time**: Mean duration of completed tasks
- **Productive Hours**: Chart showing your most productive times
- **Weekly Trends**: Task creation and completion patterns
- **Category Distribution**: Time allocation across different areas

### AI Insights

The **AI Insights** tab provides intelligent recommendations:
- **Optimization Tips**: Suggestions to improve task completion rates
- **Pattern Recognition**: Insights about your productive hours
- **Time Management**: Feedback on estimation accuracy
- **Work-Life Balance**: Recommendations for better balance

## AI Algorithm Details

### Productivity Metrics Calculation

The AI analyzes several key metrics:

```typescript
interface ProductivityMetrics {
  completionRate: number;        // Percentage of completed tasks
  averageTaskTime: number;       // Mean completion time
  productiveHours: Array<{       // Hourly productivity distribution
    hour: number;
    count: number;
  }>;
  categoryDistribution: Array<{  // Task distribution by category
    category: string;
    count: number;
    completed: number;
  }>;
  weeklyTrend: Array<{          // Daily task patterns
    date: string;
    completed: number;
    created: number;
  }>;
}
```

### Insight Generation

The AI generates insights based on:

1. **Completion Rate Analysis**
   - Flags low completion rates (<70%)
   - Suggests task breakdown strategies

2. **Time Pattern Recognition**
   - Identifies peak productivity hours
   - Recommends optimal scheduling

3. **Estimation Accuracy**
   - Compares estimated vs. actual time
   - Suggests buffer time adjustments

4. **Work-Life Balance**
   - Monitors category distribution
   - Alerts on work-heavy schedules

5. **Overdue Task Detection**
   - Identifies overdue items
   - Suggests rescheduling strategies

## Design System

### Color Palette
- **Primary**: Blue (#3B82F6) - Actions and highlights
- **Success**: Green (#10B981) - Completed tasks and positive metrics
- **Warning**: Amber (#F59E0B) - Medium priority and cautions
- **Error**: Red (#EF4444) - High priority and overdue items
- **Neutral**: Gray scale for text and backgrounds

### Typography
- **Headings**: Inter font family, weights 600-700
- **Body**: Inter font family, weight 400
